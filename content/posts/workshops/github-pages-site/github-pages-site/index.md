### Why are we doing this? 
---
Standing out in the job market nowadays requires higher visibility and Github offers _free_ personal websites for your user profile and any Github repos with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A personal website can offer:
- A useful tool for networking and building professional connections. By having a personal website, you can make it easier for others to find and contact you, and you can use it as a platform to promote your professional skills and experiences.
- A great way to share information about yourself and your interests with others. You can use it to showcase your work, share your thoughts and ideas, and connect with others who share your interests.
- Additionally, a good way to boost your online presence and improve your search engine rankings. By regularly updating your website with relevant and engaging content, you can help increase your visibility online and improve your chances of being found by potential employers or clients.

In addition, you'll be practicing coveted technical skills including:
- Git source control
- Markdown creation/modification
- Static Site generation using [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io)

### What will the site have?
---
When we're done, you'll have a personal website similar to [my site](https://darrelltang.github.io) complete with:
- Toggleable sections including
	- An About you
	- Skills
	- Projects
	- Experience
	- Achievements
	- Accomplishments
	- Publications
	- A full blog for posts
- A custom avatar (from [getavataaars.com](https://getavataaars.com/))
- A way for people to download your resume directly from your site
- Automatic deployments on update
- Free hosting on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Prerequisites
---
- A Github account
- `git` & `hugo`  installed on your computer
- A pdf copy of your resume (I recommend [myperfectresume.com](https://myperfectresume.com) if you don't have a resume or need to update it)
- A text editor (something like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is preferred but not necessary)

Make sure you have [these Prerequisites](/posts/workshops/github-pages-site/prework/) completed before the date of the workshop!
